- 👋 Hi, I’m @CraigStephen77, which says all besides my family names, including my age, hence the 77
which hopefully will get me to a wise 44years young? I've not had the easiest of lives over the years
 Although I have been successful in myself gaining a certain strength from very unfortunate, spiteful,
 And some really cruel, and unpredictable events which I had to endure in this lifetime to date.  
I am okay with it turning me into the soul and spirit which I am proud of more than words could express!
  I am also blessed to have the mind power to see so much more than many out there...
 I now am a better, stronger/passionate person than I ever would of been if I had not walked in such a
Way as I have plus witnessed much more than words could describe. I am , well have been successful in
Leaving the rubbish behind without me being any chance of living my life with any satisfaction whatsoever
 If I didn't step up and utilise my skills asap I am sure I would of been unsuccessful in reaching any
places of what is NOW some what an easier task and I'm not the slightest bit concerned about the out come!
- 👀 I’m interested in the very near future, My own entrepreneurial thingy I have been working,
And waiting on for too long already! The World created awesome things which too many times go unnoticed?
   Actually I am okay saying that I have nailed it finally,the potential I possess
I never have taken for granted mind you. But I am okay with the following statement of
"Fricken finally got there!!" The results are going to show fast and I will personally
Be in the position financially to help many people in due course... 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... about people,all over the place and whether rich or poor.
 I tend to be curious as to the people who are able to assist with alot yet I've been in
 the presence of some who amazed me to turn off and on like some do is not a nice thing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...
